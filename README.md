# DrumMachine
My implementation of a Drum Machine designed on the BeagleBone Black (BBB) with with the Bela Audio Shield

The ask was to create a system that plays a predefined set of sequence drum loops with various tempos and styles based on the input from various sensors.

- The button triggers the play and pause of the sequences.

- The potentiometer controls the tempo of the sequences.

- The LED flashes in accordance with the tempo.

- The accelerometer decides which sequence is being played.
